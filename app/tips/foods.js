Be sure to sit down and take your time during a meal; strive to truly taste and enjoy each mouthful. One tried-and-true trick to eating more slowly is to put down your fork on the table between every few bites.",

                    "description": "If you suffer from GERD, limit your fluid intake with meals. Liquids add to the volume of food in your stomach and increases stomach distension. A full belly puts more pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the muscle that normally prevents food from moving back up into your esophagus, and thus adds to your risk of reflux. To minimize stomach volume, take small sips of water while you eat, and try to drink mostly between rather than during meals.",

                    "description": "Being overweight is a major contributor to heartburn. Overweight individuals are twice as likely to suffer from symptoms of GERD as are people of a healthy weight. Extra weight may increase pressure on the stomach, causing the LES muscle to relax, which allows stomach backflow. Body fat may also release chemicals that interfere with normal digestive functioning. The good news is that research shows losing even a small amount of weight can help relieve symptoms and control heartburn.

                    "description": "The key word here is moderate. Vigorous exercises like running can agitate your digestive tract and provoke reflux, but incorporating moderate, low-impact exercises such as walking is actually beneficial (and it keeps you upright, allowing gravity to aid digestion). Exercise can also help you lose weight, which can dramatically reduce the severity of heartburn. To minimize the risk of symptoms, wait at least two hours after eating to work out; also avoid sports drinks, which may aggravate reflux due to their acidity. If you're a beginner, start slow and build up to at least 30 minutes of walking most days of the week.",

High-fat meals like these relax the LES and delay stomach emptying, making it more likely that you'll experience reflux. Instead, make lean proteins (like skinless poultry, seafood, beans, and lean cuts of red meat) and fiber-rich produce and whole grains your diet staples.",

That said, there are specific foods that can aggravate symptoms in certain individuals. The most common culprits are fried or fatty foods, alcohol, caffeinated beverages like coffee and tea, chocolate, mints and mint-flavored items, citrus juices and fruits, tomatoes and tomato sauce, spicy foods, onions, garlic, and carbonated beverages. Everyone has different triggers, though, so if you find that these foods don't cause you any discomfort, you can continue to enjoy them.",

In fact, stand up and walk around to help encourage the gastric juices to flow in the right direction. For the same reason, while sleeping, keep your upper body elevated by placing a few books or a foam wedge underneath the mattress or propping up the legs at the head of the bed with blocks or books.",

Just make sure to choose non-mint flavors, since peppermint and spearmint can relax the LES and exacerbate symptoms. Pick up cinnamon or fruit flavors instead.",
